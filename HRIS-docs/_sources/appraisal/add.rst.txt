Creating Questionnaire

Creating a questionnaire for appraisal purpose is made easy with HRIS. One can easily create and assign various questions that can be configured to be asked to specific personnel e.g. appraisee, recommendor, approver or HR.

Questions are defined in an hierarchy:

* Stage
	* Heading

Appraisal Stage
++++++++++++++++++++++

In HRIS, an appraisal process is started by defining the *stages*. A *stage* is the term defining where the appraisal process has reached. For example, The first stage is called *begining* and on this stage, the questions are answerable only by the appraisee in question. After the employee answers the question, depending upon the setup on your installation, it might need to go to the *Appraiser Evaluation* stage.
