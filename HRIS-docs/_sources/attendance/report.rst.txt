Attendance Report
************************
The attendance report allows a manager or HR personnel to quickly view attendance for employees. The attendance report is controlled with the access control logic so that one can only see the reports for the employees whose data is accessible for them. 
Attendance report is visible for managers from the Manager Service Menu and from the HR menu for HR personnel.
