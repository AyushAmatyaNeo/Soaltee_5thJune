Subordinate Request Status
******************************

The status reporting portal lets a manager quickly see request status regarding employees under their management. A manager can quickly go through the requests for attendance, leave, travel, training, overtime, work on holiday, loan etc.  relating to their subordinates.  

These reports are similar to what we see in the approval panel, but the approval panel only lists the requests for which there is a decision pending. Once the approval/rejection is done, it doesnt appear in the Approval Panel. They are now moved to the status reports. One can see the request details and historical data in the status reports.

Most of the status reports come with a filter bar, that lets the managers quickly filter employees combining filters for company, branch, department, service status, request status(pending/recommended/approved/rejected), types specific to the requests, date ranges, etc.
