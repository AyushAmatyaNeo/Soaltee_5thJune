
Leave Record Management
*************************

Leave Management system would store the leave consumed by employees of the organization with specific details about leave types. It should consider inclusion of at least the following facts:

*	Leave Type
*	Entitlement
*	Consumed Leave  on particular duration (week, month, year)
*	Earned Balance till yet
*	Claimable Balance till yet
*	Cashable Balance until yet


Leave Configuration

Configuration of each leave type should be parameterized with the following considerations: 

* Applicable Leave Types: Any particular leave type might not be applicable to all employees. Hence, its associated applicable leave types should be always definable. 
* Minimum Avail Duration: Half Day/Full Day
* Carry Forward: Defining whether any particular leave type can be carried forward to another fiscal year or not, if yes, is there any limit to the maximum accumulation or not. 
* Holiday/Week off Exclusion: Yes/No
